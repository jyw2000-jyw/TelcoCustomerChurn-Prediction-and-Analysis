## Acknowledgement
I do appreciate the opportunity of this online research camp, which let me know the excellent students from home and abroad and the professional tutor team led by [**Prof. Mark Vogelsberger**](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/mark-vogelsberger/) (Associate Professor, MIT). In these two months, I have a deeper understanding of the specific application of machine learning in real life. The proper use of big data technology can help guide decision-making and save resource costs. Farewell!
